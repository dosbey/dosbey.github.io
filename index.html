                <h2>Problem Statement: Class Tracker</h2>
                <p>Itâ€™s widely known that students struggle with arriving to class on time. Whether it is traffic or sleeping in, students are still late to class. Our solution for this is to create a class tracker app that will calculate what time the student needs to leave in order to be on time. The app will also show how much class time you have left when you are in the classroom.
